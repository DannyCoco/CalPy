CalPy: The Python Calculator
CalPy is a simple Python calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It’s designed to be user-friendly and efficient, with the following features:

1. User Interaction:
When you run CalPy, it displays a menu with options for different operations.
You can choose to add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers.
There’s also an option to clear the previous output or quit the calculator.
2. Persistent Output:
CalPy remembers the most recent output, allowing you to use it as the first operand for subsequent calculations.
This feature enhances usability, especially during repetitive calculations.
3. Code Organization:
The project consists of two main files:
main.py: The entry point for running the calculator.
calculations.py: Contains the implementation of arithmetic operations.
By separating concerns, your code follows good practices for maintainability.
4. Python Expertise Demonstrated:
You’ve utilized Python functions effectively to encapsulate each operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
Error handling using try and except for input validation shows attention to detail.
The modular design promotes code readability and reusability.
Usage
Run main.py to start CalPy.
Follow the on-screen instructions to perform calculations.
Enjoy the convenience of persistent output!
